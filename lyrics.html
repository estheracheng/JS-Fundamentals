    Life is easy, when you are up on the mountain <br>
    And you've got peace of mind, like you've never known
    But things change when you're down in the valley
    Don't lose faith, for you're never alone<br>



    For the God on the mountain, is still God in the valley
    When things go wrong, He'll make them right
    And the God of the good times, is still God in the bad times
    The God of the day is still God in the night<br>



    You talk of faith when you're up on the mountain
    But talk comes so easy when life's at it's best
    Now it's down in the valleys, of trials and temptations
    That's where your faith, is really put to the test<br>



    For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley
    When things go wrong, He'll make them right
    And the God of the good times, is still God in the bad times
    The God of the day, is still God in the night
    The God of the day, is still God in the night<br>
